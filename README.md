A parent repository hosting the database and python app codebases currently used to serve the Water Node's STAC API.

This is just meant to collect the specific stack being run by the WPN public data catalog API in one place. The subrepositories are all forked from codebases that are in active development and should be kept mostly in sync with those codebases with the exception of changes made to the API deemed necessary for the functioning of the WPN catalog.
